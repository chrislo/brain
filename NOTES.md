* Todo list

- [ ] Allow the sampler to play different files
- [ ] Adopt the OSC message format used by Sonic Pi's [osmid](https://github.com/llloret/osmid)
- [ ] Pitch/rate control of samples
- [x] Make the sequencer do something more useful

* Notes

In [Tom Maisey's ADC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjri_jPLyU8) he introduces the idea of using immutable functions in a sequencer app. I think I could try something like that in Rust.
