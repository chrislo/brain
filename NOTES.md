* Notes

In [Tom Maisey's ADC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjri_jPLyU8) he introduces the idea of using immutable functions in a sequencer app. I think I could try something like that in Rust.

This [Attack magazine interview with Roger Linn](https://www.attackmagazine.com/features/interview/roger-linn-swing-groove-magic-mpc-timing/) has details of the swing and quantization features on the MPC drum machines.
